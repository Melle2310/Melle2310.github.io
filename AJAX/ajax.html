            <h2><img src="donny.jpg" class="donny">Dream Like Donny</h2>
            <p>Earlier this week one of our own left the club. Donny van de Beek left Ajax and signed for Manchester United. Donny joined Ajax in 2008 at age 11. His journey at our club has been incredible. After aking his first team debut as a youngster in 2015 we have seen him grow as a person and player right in front of our eyes. He evolved into a real leader on the field. His energy and work ethic has always been unmatched. Thats why he, and Ajax as a club have achieved big things together. He played for Ajax in the Europa League final against his new club Manchester United. He was also a big part of our incredible season 2 years ago, when Ajax won the Title, the Dutch cup and Ajax made it all the way to the semi-final in the Champions League. Donny made so many great memories at the club, but now it is time for him to move on. Dream even bigger. Good luck in Manchester, Donny! </p>

            <h1> <img src="homejersey.jpg" class="ouch"> Simply Beautiful  </h1>
            <p> Every year Ajax, in collaboration with adidas, introduces it's new home jersey for the upcoming season. This new home jersey is the jersey in which Ajax will play in the Johan Cruijff ArenA. The jersey is characterized by the subtle red/white details that pay tribute to the city of Amsterdam and the red and white flag of Amsterdam in particular, to honor the bond between the city and the club.
