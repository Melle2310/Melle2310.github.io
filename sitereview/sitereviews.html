            <h1> Bad Website: <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/
" target="_blank"> Lings’ Cars</a> </h1>
            <p>It looks like they were trying to throw all the information they had at you while also trying to be clever a lot of with unnecessary animations. The site has a lot of texts, images, links, ads on every single page and bright colors everywhere. They tried to make the website exciting with lots of stuff going on, like the colors, ads, images and links, but this looks way too messy and it’s very distracting. It just doesn’t look like an organized and inviting website for possible car buyers, because of the different bright colors and moving images. </p>
            <p>The code used for the website is modern and it uses HTML 5 elements. They didn’t use table elements in the code, but the layout does have 3 columns. A menu bar on the left, lots of images in the center and tabs for different cars on the right. The columns are clear, but it’s pretty hard to navigate the website, because the look of the it is so confusing with so many images links and texts all over the page. But after looking at the page for a minute you start to figure it out and you’ll be able to navigate through the website without too many problems. </p>
            <h2>Good Website 1: <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">ESPN </a></h2>
            <p>The website is very well organized. On the top it shows the scores of current games of games played earlier in the day, to give important information to the visitors right away. Underneath that it has a very clear menu bar. For each page it has 3 columns that were not coded with table element. The columns are very well designed, with links to different pages or social medias on the left, the information and images in the middle and headlines and additional articles on the right. The colors used are very simple, but it looks good and it works well to keep the website organized and good looking. They also curved the edges of all the columns and the articles to make it more pleasing to the eye. The well organized menu bars and columns with links and headlines make it really easy to navigate the website. The code used for the website is modern and it uses HTML 5 elements. </p>
            <h3>Good Website 2: <a href="https://www.ajax.nl/" target="_blank">AJAX</a> </h3>
            <p>The website looks very good. They used the colors of the soccer club, red and white to really make the website their own and to attract their fans to visit the website, because the fans can then relate the page to the club they support. The menu bar on the top of the page looks good and is easy to navigate. The pages are not split up into columns, the website consists of figures instead. Each figure links to a different article, video or page. These images really make the pages look good, interesting and different. The website does have column, but they don’t fill the whole page. So on one of the pages the left column has the upcoming games and the right has the current standings. They did use the table element to make these columns. The code for the website is modern and they did use HTML 5 elements. </p>
