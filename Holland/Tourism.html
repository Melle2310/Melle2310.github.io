                <h3 id="anne">Anne Frank House</h3>
                <p>he Anne Frank House is a must-see when in Amsterdam. In the home where Anne's family (Jewish refugees from Frankfurt) hid for much of WWII, is where this remarkable girl wrote her famous diary. Although she died just two months before the war ended, her legacy lives on through her words, which have since been translated into 51 languages.</p>
                <p> The back of the now restored house where the Frank family had their hiding place has been kept in its original state as much as possible. It's an important piece of one of the most tragic events in world history. A brave young girl who continues to inspire people around the world. </p><img id="meers" src="meer.jpg">
                <h3 id="meer">The Ijsselmeer (Zuiderzee)</h3>
                <p>Among the most beautiful villages in the Netherlands are the small hamlets along the Ijsselmeer, the freshwater lake that was created by building the "Afsluitdijk", the dyke that closes the see entrance to the Zuiderzee. These towns flourished during the Netherlands' Golden Age, when they had access to the Atlantic and prospered as fishing and trade centers. They lost importance as the harbors silted up.</p>
