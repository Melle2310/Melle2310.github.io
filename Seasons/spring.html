            <h1>Trees in the Spring</h1>
            <h2>Leaves</h2>
            <p>Leaves appear on trees in the spring. They burst out of buds in which they have remained dormant all winter long. Sunlight triggers the bud break. In the spring, the sun gets brighter and brighter, and the days longer. Buds contain a kind of cell that is sensitive to light. It detects when there is enough daylight for the leaves to survive.</p>
            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>The flowers of most trees are not readily evident. They often don't have petals and are frequently green or reddish, which makes them hard to distinguish from leaves. Flowers appear at almost the same time as leaves, in the spring, and are often contained in the same buds. They remain on the trees only a few days, just long enough to be fertilized. Some trees have two kinds of flowers: male and female. The male flowers only produce pollen; the female flowers only have stigma. Most trees rely on the wind to spread pollen to their female flowers. If you look at puddles or even on cars in the spring, you may notice a fine, yellow powder. It's tree pollen. </p>
